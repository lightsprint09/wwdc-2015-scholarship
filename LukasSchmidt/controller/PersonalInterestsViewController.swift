I learned a lot about programming and felt confinement enough to lern Objective - C. I had to learn it on my own because we haven Â´t any Macs at our campus.\n\nMaking software for medical use is hard because it could affect the life of other humans. We constantly think about how technology can improve medical systems and consumer healthcare. I like being part of this.", "code": "I care deeply in crafting creat software. But for me as an software engineer the look and feel of the software is just as important as reducing complexity, removing redundant code and getting better test coverage. "];
